After approving violations, generate actionable remediation steps to fix the underlying compliance issues.

## How Remediation Works

Yggdrasil uses AI to analyze violations and suggest specific, context-aware remediation actions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an approved violation">
    Open the evidence drawer for any violation with status `approved`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate remediation">
    Click "Generate Remediation Steps." The system sends violation details to Gemini:
    - Policy excerpt violated
    - Evidence from your data
    - Rule conditions and thresholds
    - Severity and confidence score
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review AI suggestions">
    Gemini returns:
    - **Immediate actions:** Steps to address this specific violation
    - **Process improvements:** Changes to prevent future violations
    - **Documentation updates:** Policy or procedure changes
    - **Risk assessment:** Impact and urgency
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implement or customize">
    Use the suggestions as a starting point. Remediation steps are advisory — you're responsible for execution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Remediation Components

### Immediate Actions
Steps to resolve the specific violation:

**Example (AML structuring violation):**
1. Flag account `ACC-501234` for manual review
2. Review all transactions from this account in the past 30 days
3. File a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) if structuring is confirmed
4. Consider account suspension pending investigation

### Process Improvements
Longer-term changes to reduce future violations:

**Example:**
- Implement real-time transaction monitoring for structuring patterns
- Lower alert threshold to $8,000 (from $10,000) to catch edge cases
- Add automated velocity checks (3+ transactions within 24 hours)

### Documentation Updates
Policy or procedure changes:

**Example:**
- Update AML policy to explicitly define structuring patterns
- Add training module on structuring detection for compliance staff
- Document escalation procedures for multi-transaction violations

### Risk Assessment
Impact analysis:

**Example:**
- **Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Regulatory Impact:** Potential FinCEN penalty ($10K-$100K per violation)
- **Urgency:** Respond within 15 days per 31 CFR § 1010.311
- **Related Regulations:** Bank Secrecy Act, CTR requirements

## AI Context

When generating remediation, Gemini receives:

```json
{
  "violation_id": "abc-123",
  "rule_name": "Currency Transaction Report (CTR) Threshold",
  "policy_excerpt": "Transactions exceeding $10,000 must be reported...",
  "policy_section": "31 CFR § 1010.311",
  "evidence": {
    "account": "ACC-501234",
    "amount": 12500,
    "transaction_type": "WIRE",
    "timestamp": "2026-02-15T14:32:00Z"
  },
  "explanation": "This record violates the CTR threshold rule because...",
  "severity": "CRITICAL",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```

Gemini analyzes this context and returns tailored suggestions.

<Note>
  Remediation is only available for **approved** violations. Dismissed violations (false positives) don't require remediation.
</Note>

## Example Remediation Outputs

### GDPR Consent Violation
**Violation:** Marketing email sent without explicit consent

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Cease all marketing communications to `data_subject_id: 12345`
2. Verify consent status in CRM
3. If consent missing, send apology email with opt-in request
4. Document incident in GDPR compliance log

**Process Improvements:**
1. Implement double opt-in for marketing lists
2. Add automated consent checks before email sends
3. Audit entire marketing database for consent status

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Risk Level:** HIGH
- **Regulatory Impact:** GDPR Article 6 violation, potential fine up to €20M or 4% revenue
- **Urgency:** Immediate (72-hour breach notification if data compromised)

### SOC2 Encryption Violation
**Violation:** Sensitive data transmitted without encryption

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Identify all systems transmitting unencrypted data
2. Halt data transmission until TLS 1.3 is enabled
3. Audit logs for past 90 days to identify exposure scope
4. Notify affected data subjects if PII was exposed

**Process Improvements:**
1. Mandate TLS 1.3 for all internal and external APIs
2. Implement automated checks for encryption status
3. Add encryption requirements to vendor contracts

**Documentation Updates:**
1. Update security policy to require encryption at rest and in transit
2. Add encryption standards to onboarding checklist for new systems
3. Document encryption key rotation procedures

## Remediation API

```bash
POST /api/violations/{violation_id}/remediation
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "violation_id": "abc-123",
  "remediation": {
    "immediate_actions": [ ... ],
    "process_improvements": [ ... ],
    "documentation_updates": [ ... ],
    "risk_assessment": { ... }
  },
  "generated_at": "2026-02-22T10:15:00Z"
}
```

<Warning>
  Remediation suggestions are AI-generated and may not be legally accurate. Always consult your compliance/legal team before implementing.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### 1. Prioritize by Severity
Generate remediation for CRITICAL violations first, then HIGH, then MEDIUM.

### 2. Batch Similar Violations
If multiple violations stem from the same root cause (e.g., missing encryption), group them and implement a single process improvement.

### 3. Track Implementation
Use the `review_note` field to document:
- Which remediation steps were implemented
- Who implemented them
- Completion dates

### 4. Re-scan After Remediation
After applying fixes:
1. Upload the updated dataset
2. Run a new scan
3. Verify the violation no longer appears

### 5. Document in Audit Trail
For regulatory audits, maintain records of:
- Original violation evidence
- Remediation steps taken
- Completion dates
- Re-scan results confirming resolution

## Limitations

- **AI-generated:** Suggestions are not legal advice
- **Context-limited:** AI only sees violation data, not your full organizational context
- **Generic:** Some suggestions may not apply to your specific environment
- **No automation:** Yggdrasil does not execute remediation — you must implement manually

<Note>
  Treat remediation suggestions as a checklist to review with your compliance team, not as definitive instructions.
</Note>

## Next Steps

After reviewing remediation:

1. Implement approved actions
2. Update your policies and procedures
3. Re-scan your dataset to verify fixes
4. Export the compliance report with remediation notes for auditors
