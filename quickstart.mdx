This guide walks you through creating your first compliance audit on Yggdrasil, from signup to reviewing violations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Sign up at the Yggdrasil platform. You'll be prompted to create an account using email authentication.

    After signing in, you'll land on the dashboard where you can view your scan history and compliance trends.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start a new audit">
    Click **New Audit** from the dashboard or navigate to `/audit/new`.

    You'll be prompted to:
    - **Name your audit** (e.g., "Q1 2026 AML Review")
    - **Select a policy framework** to scan against
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a prebuilt policy">
    Yggdrasil includes three production-ready policy frameworks:

    - **AML / FinCEN** — 11 rules covering currency transaction reports, structuring detection, velocity limits, dormant account reactivation, round amount patterns, and suspicious activity thresholds
    - **GDPR** — 14+ rules for consent management, encryption requirements, data subject rights, third-country transfers, and processing records
    - **SOC2** — 5 trust principle rules covering Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, and Privacy

    Select the framework that matches your compliance needs. You can also upload a custom PDF policy document — Yggdrasil will use AI to extract enforceable rules from the regulatory text.

    <Tip>
      If you're testing the platform for the first time, start with **AML** and use the included demo dataset: `fraud_detection_subset_50k.csv` (available in the platform's public folder).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload your dataset">
    Upload a CSV file containing the data you want to scan for compliance violations.

    Yggdrasil will:
    - Detect the schema automatically
    - Suggest column mappings using AI (e.g., mapping `"tx_amount"` to the expected `"amount"` field)
    - Display a preview of your data

    <Note>
      The platform supports up to 50,000 rows per scan. Larger datasets will be sampled automatically.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and confirm column mappings">
    Before the scan runs, you'll see the suggested column mappings:

    ```
    CSV Column          →  Expected Field
    ─────────────────────────────────────
    tx_amount           →  amount
    account_id          →  account
    tx_type             →  transaction_type
    timestamp           →  timestamp
    ```

    **You must approve these mappings.** No data transformations happen behind the scenes — transparency is a core design principle.

    If the AI mapping is incorrect, you can manually adjust it before confirming.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review rules (optional)">
    Before running the scan, you can review the rules that will be evaluated against your data.

    Each rule displays:
    - **Rule name** and **severity** (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM)
    - **Policy excerpt** — the exact regulatory clause it enforces
    - **Conditions** — the compound boolean logic (AND/OR trees) used to detect violations

    You can toggle individual rules on or off. Disabled rules won't fire during the scan.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the compliance scan">
    Click **Start Scan**.

    The deterministic rule engine will:
    1. Normalize your CSV data (type coercion, field mapping)
    2. Evaluate each active rule against your records
    3. Apply confidence scoring (rule quality + signal specificity + statistical anomaly detection + Bayesian precision)
    4. Generate violations with full explainability

    Scans typically complete in seconds for datasets under 10,000 rows.

    <Info>
      The rule engine is **deterministic** — no ML models run in the enforcement loop. This makes results reproducible and audit-ready.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review violations">
    After the scan completes, you'll see a dashboard with:

    - **Compliance score** (0–100) based on violation count and severity
    - **Violations by severity** — CRITICAL, HIGH, and MEDIUM counts
    - **Violations by rule** — which rules triggered the most findings
    - **Violations by account** — accounts with the most compliance issues

    Click on any violation to open the **evidence drawer**, which shows:
    - The **policy excerpt** that was violated
    - The **matched conditions** that triggered the rule
    - The **evidence grid** — the exact field values from your data that caused the violation
    - A **natural-language explanation** (generated from deterministic templates, not LLM calls)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve or dismiss violations">
    For each violation, you can:

    - **Approve** — Mark as a confirmed true positive
    - **Dismiss as false positive** — Mark as incorrect

    Your feedback is used in a **Bayesian precision model** that updates rule confidence:

    ```
    precision = (1 + true_positives) / (2 + true_positives + false_positives)
    ```

    Rules that produce false positives lose confidence over time. Rules that catch real issues gain confidence. Your reviews make the next scan better.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export your report">
    Once you've reviewed violations, export a full compliance report as JSON:

    ```bash
    GET /api/export?scanId={scan_id}
    ```

    The export includes:
    - Scan metadata (policy, dataset, timestamps)
    - All violations with evidence and explanations
    - Compliance score breakdown
    - PII findings (if PII detection was enabled)
  </Step>
</Steps>
