The **SOC2 Compliance Pack** provides 9 production-ready rules based on the AICPA Trust Services Criteria, covering the five trust principles: **Security**, **Availability**, **Confidentiality**, **Processing Integrity**, and **Privacy**.

Each rule includes breach cost data, real-world examples, and Common Criteria references (CC).

## Trust Principles

SOC2 rules are organized into five trust service criteria:

## Using the SOC2 Pack

1. **Select SOC2 Framework** — Choose "SOC2" when creating a new audit
2. **Choose Trust Principles** — All 9 rules are loaded; toggle rules based on your SOC2 scope (Type I vs Type II)
3. **Upload Data** — Upload your system access logs, user database, or configuration exports
4. **Confirm Mapping** — Map your columns to fields like `mfa_enabled`, `is_encrypted`, `tenant_id`, etc.
5. **Run Scan** — Execute the compliance scan
6. **Review Violations** — Violations include Common Criteria references and breach cost estimates

<Note>
SOC2 audits typically focus on **controls** rather than raw data scans. Use Yggdrasil's SOC2 pack to validate that your data layer adheres to the Common Criteria controls before your formal audit.
</Note>

## SOC2 Type I vs Type II

| Audit Type | Scope | Yggdrasil Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **Type I** | Design effectiveness at a point in time | Run a one-time scan to validate controls are in place |
| **Type II** | Operating effectiveness over 6-12 months | Run periodic scans and track score history to demonstrate continuous compliance |
