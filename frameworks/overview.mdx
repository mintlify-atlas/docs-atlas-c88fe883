title: Policy Frameworks Overview
description: Choose from prebuilt AML, GDPR, and SOC2 frameworks or upload custom regulatory PDFs

Yggdrasil provides both **prebuilt policy frameworks** for common regulatory standards and support for **custom PDF upload** to extract rules from any compliance document.

## Prebuilt Frameworks

Yggdrasil ships with production-ready rule packs for three major regulatory frameworks:

  <Card title="AML / FinCEN" icon="money-bill-trend-up" href="/frameworks/aml">
    11 rules covering currency transaction reporting, structuring detection, and suspicious activity monitoring
  </Card>
  <Card title="GDPR" icon="shield-check" href="/frameworks/gdpr">
    15 rules across consent, encryption, DPO requirements, and data subject rights
  </Card>
  <Card title="SOC2" icon="lock" href="/frameworks/soc2">
    9 rules mapped to the five SOC2 trust principles (Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, Privacy)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why Use Prebuilt Frameworks?

- **Instant deployment** — Rules are ready to use immediately with no extraction step
- **Battle-tested logic** — Each rule includes real-world historical context and average fines
- **Compound conditions** — Rules combine multiple signals (behavioral + temporal + relational) to minimize false positives
- **Explainability** — Every rule includes policy excerpts, article references, and breach examples

## Custom PDF Upload

For proprietary or industry-specific regulations, upload any regulatory PDF and let Gemini 2.5 Flash extract structured, enforceable rules.

<Card title="Custom PDF Extraction" icon="file-pdf" href="/frameworks/custom-pdf">
  Upload any compliance document and extract rules with the Signal Specificity Framework
</Card>

### How It Works

1. **Upload PDF** — Upload your regulatory document (AML, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, internal policy, etc.)
2. **AI Extraction** — Gemini parses the document and identifies enforceable clauses
3. **Rule Generation** — Each rule is converted to compound boolean logic with thresholds
4. **Quality Filtering** — Only rules meeting minimum specificity threshold (2.0) are accepted

### Key Differences

| Feature | Prebuilt Frameworks | Custom PDF |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup Time** | Instant | 30-60 seconds (extraction) |
| **Rule Quality** | Hand-curated | AI-extracted + validated |
| **Customization** | Fixed rules (can be toggled) | Fully custom to your document |
| **Historical Context** | Includes fines & breach examples | Policy text only |
| **Use Case** | Standard compliance (AML, GDPR, SOC2) | Industry-specific or proprietary policies |

## Choosing the Right Approach

**Use prebuilt frameworks when:**
- You need to comply with AML/FinCEN, GDPR, or SOC2
- You want production-ready rules with minimal configuration
- You need historical fine data and breach examples for risk assessment

**Use custom PDF upload when:**
- You have industry-specific regulations (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GLBA, etc.)
- You're enforcing internal company policies
- You need rules extracted from proprietary compliance documents
- You want full control over the regulatory text source

## What Happens After Selection

Regardless of which approach you choose:

1. **Review Rules** — All extracted or prebuilt rules are shown for review
2. **Toggle Activation** — Enable or disable individual rules before scanning
3. **Map Your Data** — Connect your CSV columns to the schema fields required by rules
4. **Run Scan** — Execute deterministic rule evaluation against your dataset
5. **Review Violations** — Get explainable results with policy excerpts and evidence

<Note>
All rule execution is **deterministic** — no AI models are used in the enforcement loop. Explanations are generated from templates, not LLM calls.
