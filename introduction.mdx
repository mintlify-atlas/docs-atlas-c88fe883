## What is Yggdrasil?

Yggdrasil is an autonomous policy-to-data compliance engine that transforms regulatory PDFs into enforceable rules and scans your datasets for violations. Upload a regulatory document, connect your data, and get audit-ready compliance violations with every finding traced back to the exact policy clause.

**No auditors. No black boxes.**

Yggdrasil bridges the gap between PDF policy documents and database enforcement. The system extracts enforceable rules from regulatory text using AI, maps them to your data schema, and runs a deterministic scan that produces audit-ready violations with full explainability.

## Why Yggdrasil?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deterministic enforcement">
    The rule engine is pure logic with no ML models in the critical path. Rules are evaluated as compound boolean expressions (AND/OR trees) against each record, making results reproducible and audit-ready.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Explainability by default">
    Every violation includes the exact policy excerpt it violates, the evidence from your data, and a condition summary. Explanations are generated from string templates, not LLM calls.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Signal Specificity Framework">
    Rules extracted from PDFs must combine multiple signals (behavioral + temporal + relational) to reach a minimum specificity threshold before they can fire. Single-threshold rules are rejected to minimize false positives.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bayesian feedback loop">
    When you approve or dismiss a violation, that feedback updates a per-rule precision model. Rules that produce false positives lose confidence over time. Your reviews make the next scan better.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Supported compliance frameworks

Yggdrasil comes with prebuilt policy frameworks and supports custom regulatory documents:

- **AML / FinCEN** - 11 rules covering currency transaction reports, structuring detection, velocity limits, dormant account reactivation, and suspicious activity thresholds
- **GDPR** - 14+ categories including consent management, data protection requirements, encryption, privacy impact assessments, and right of access/erasure
- **SOC2** - 5 trust principles covering security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, and privacy
- **Custom PDF** - Upload any regulatory document and let Gemini extract rules using the Signal Specificity Framework

<Note>
  All rule extraction requires a minimum combined specificity of 2.0, ensuring each rule combines multiple signals for reduced false positives.
